# Deno Api

just a simple Deno REST API 

Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.

+ Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.

+ Supports TypeScript out of the box.

+ Ships only a single executable file.

+ Has built-in utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a code formatter (deno fmt).

+ Has a set of reviewed (audited) standard modules that are guaranteed to work with Deno: deno.land/std
